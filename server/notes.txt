What is SQL?(Core theory)
SQL= Structure Query language
SQL is:
   -A language
   -Used to store, read ,update, delete
   -Data stored in relational database
SQL is not a database
MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle are databases that understand SQL 


Relational database - What does it mean?

A relational database store data in:
 - Tables
 - Connected via relationships

Example 
instead of one big json:

{
    "user":{
        "name":"Suhail",
        "orders":{...}
    }
}


SQL does:
 -One Table for user
 - One table for orders
 -Linked using keys

The avoids: duplication inconsistency messy updates 

Core Building Blocks
1)database
Top:level container

server
  |
  --- database
        |
        ------Tables
           |
           -------- Rows
                     |
                     --------- Columns

MongoDB equivalent:
Cluster -> Databse -> Collection -> Document -> Fields 





2) Table

A table is:

 - like an Excel Sheet 
 - Has fixed Columns
 - Each row follows same Structure

Example

 id  name.  email 
 1.  Suhail suahil@code.in 

Unlike MongoDB , every row must match  schema 

3) ROW(Record)

 - one complete data entry 
 - One real-world entity 

4) Column (Fields)

 - Defines what type of data 
 - has data type
 - has contraints 

5) Data type(Theory)

common SQL types:

 Type                    Meaning 
 INT.                    Number 
 VARCHAR(n)              Text (limit length)
 TEXT                    Long test 
 BOOLEAN                 true/false
 Date                    Date only 
 TIMESTAMP               Date+time 
 DECIMAL                 Money/precision 
 ENUM                    Fixed Values 

 SQl is strictly typed MongoDB is Flexible 


KEYS (Very important theory)


Primary KEY 
  - uniquely identifies a row
  - Cannot be NULL 
  - Cannot repeat 

         id  INT Primary KEY 

    MongoDB equivalent:
        _id 


Foreign key 

 - Connets Two table
 - Enforces relationships 

   orders.user_id -> users.id 

This is what makes SQL: relational 

   relationships types 


    1) One-to-One 
    User ↔ Profile
        user.id → profile.user_id


    2) One-to-Many(Most common)
    user <-> orders 
        users.id -> orders.user_id 

    3)Many-to-Many 
    students <-> Courses 
     
    Solving using junction table: 
     
        student_courses 
        (student_id,course_id)


contraints (data safety rules)

Constraints protect your data

Constraint	        Meaning

NOT NULL	       Value required
UNIQUE	           No duplicates
DEFAULT	           Auto value
CHECK	           Custom rule
FOREIGN KEY	       Relationship enforcement


Example: 
email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL 



ACID properties (Why sql is trusted )

sql databases follow ACID 
    property     Meaning 
    Atomicity   All or nothing 
    Consistency rules always valid
    Isolation   Transaction don't clash 
    Durability  Dara never lost 

This is why banking apps use SQL 
MongoDB supports this partially, sql does it by design 




Transaction(Theory)

A Transaction = multiple steps treated as one unit 

Example: 
  1) Deduct Money 
  2) add order 

if step 2 fails -> step 1 is undone 


    Begin 
        step1 
        step2 
    Commit/Rollback 


Normalization(Design Theory)

Goal: 

  - Avoid duplication
  - avoids anomalies 

bad Design 
    users 
    id | name | order1 | order2 | order3 

Good design 
 
    users 
    orders 



SQL architecture (How is works )

 Client (Express / App)
   ↓ SQL Query
Query Parser
   ↓
Optimizer
   ↓
Execution Engine
   ↓
Storage Engine



Important SQL teminology 
Term	                Meaning

Schema	                Structure of tables
Index	                Faster search
View                	Virtual table
Stored Procedure	    Saved logic
Trigger 	            Auto actions
Migration           	Schema changes


SQL Mindset shift (Fron MONGO)

❌Embed everything ❌Flexible Structure 

✅Think in relations ✅Think in joins.  ✅Design first,code later  

✅ WHAT YOU SHOULD REMEMBER NOW

SQL is structured & relational
Tables are connected via keys
Schema is strict
Data integrity is core
SQL shines in critical systems
